      <h2 className="organic-subtitle">Why is Organic Waste Recycling Important?</h2>
      <ul className="organic-benefits-list">
        <li><strong>Environmental Protection:</strong> Proper recycling reduces landfill burden, minimizes methane emissions, and mitigates soil and water contamination, protecting ecosystems and public health.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Recovery:</strong> Recycling organic waste recovers valuable nutrients, which can be used in soil amendments and fertilizers, enhancing soil health and promoting sustainable agriculture.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Benefits:</strong> The organic waste recycling industry creates jobs, supports local economies, and reduces waste management costs by diverting waste from landfills.</li>
        <li><strong>Climate Change Mitigation:</strong> Proper management of organic waste reduces greenhouse gas emissions by preventing anaerobic decomposition in landfills.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="organic-subtitle">Our Organic Waste Management Process</h2>
      <div className="organic-waste-management">
      <h3 className="organic-process-step">1. Collection and Transportation</h3>
      <p className="organic-process-description">
        We manage the collection of organic waste from various sources, including households, restaurants, farms, and food processing units. Our logistics network ensures the safe transportation of collected organic waste to recycling facilities, adhering to environmental regulations.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div className="organic-waste-management">
      <h3 className="organic-process-step">2. Sorting and Pre-processing</h3>
      <p className="organic-process-description">
        At recycling facilities, organic waste is sorted to remove non-biodegradable materials like plastics and metals. Pre-processing involves shredding or grinding the organic waste to improve the efficiency of the recycling methods, such as anaerobic digestion or composting.
      </p>
      </div>
      <div className="organic-waste-management">
      <h3 className="organic-process-step">3. Recycling Process</h3>
      <p className="organic-process-description">
        We employ two main recycling methods:
      </p>
      <ul className="organic-recycling-methods-list">
        <li><strong>Anaerobic Digestion:</strong> Organic waste is broken down in an oxygen-free environment, producing biogas and digestate. This involves hydrolysis, acidogenesis, and methanogenesis stages.</li>
        <li><strong>Composting:</strong> A natural process where organic matter is decomposed aerobically, producing nutrient-rich compost that enhances soil health.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <div className="organic-waste-management">
      <h3 className="organic-process-step">4. Production of End Products</h3>
      <ul className="organic-products-list">
        <li><strong>Biogas:</strong> Used for generating renewable energy, biogas can be converted into electricity or heat.</li>
        <li><strong>Digestate:</strong> A nutrient-rich soil amendment produced from anaerobic digestion.</li>
        <li><strong>Compost:</strong> High-quality organic fertilizer produced through composting, improving soil health and supporting sustainable agriculture.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>
      <div className="organic-waste-management">
      <h3 className="organic-process-step">5. Compliance with Environmental Regulations</h3>
