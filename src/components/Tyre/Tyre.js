      <h2 className="tyre-subtitle">Importance of Tyre Recycling</h2>
      <ul className="tyre-benefits-list">
        <li><strong>Environmental Protection:</strong> Tyres contain hazardous materials that can leach into the soil and water, posing risks to ecosystems and human health. Recycling helps mitigate these risks.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Recovery:</strong> Approximately 60% of a tyre is made from recoverable materials, including rubber, steel, and fiber. Recycling conserves natural resources and reduces the need for new raw materials.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Efficiency:</strong> Recycling tyres can save significant amounts of energy compared to producing new rubber, making it a more sustainable option.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Benefits:</strong> Tyre recycling generates jobs and promotes the development of green technologies within local economies.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="tyre-step-title">2. Shredding and Granulation</h3>
      <p className="tyre-step-content">
        Upon arrival at our recycling partnersâ€™ facilities, tyres undergo mechanical shredding, reducing them into smaller pieces. The shredded tyres are further processed into granules of various sizes, suitable for different applications. Advanced machinery, including knife mills and granulators, ensures efficient processing and minimal material loss.

      <p className="tyre-step-content">
        Our partners utilize state-of-the-art technology to separate materials, including steel wire extracted using magnetic separation techniques, textile fibers removed through advanced screening, and rubber powder ground into fine rubber powder through cryogenic or ambient grinding methods. The recycling process can recover up to 90% of the tyre's material, making it suitable for reuse in various applications.
