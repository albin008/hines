      <h2 className="usedoil-subtitle">Why is Used Oil Recycling Important?</h2>
      <ul className="usedoil-benefits-list">
        <li><strong>Environmental Protection:</strong> Improper disposal of used oil can lead to severe soil and water contamination, posing risks to ecosystems and human health. Recycling used oil prevents these harmful effects, protecting natural resources and minimizing pollution.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Recovery:</strong> Recycling used oil conserves valuable resources by reclaiming base oils, which can be reused in new oil products. This reduces the demand for virgin oil extraction and processing, leading to lower greenhouse gas emissions.</li>
        <li><strong>Economic Benefits:</strong> The used oil recycling industry creates jobs, stimulates innovation in recycling technologies, and contributes to local economies by promoting sustainable practices and reducing waste disposal costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Regulatory Compliance:</strong> Proper management of used oil is essential for compliance with environmental regulations and laws, ensuring businesses meet their legal obligations while reducing liability and potential fines.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="usedoil-subtitle">Our Used Oil Waste Management Process</h2>
      <div className="usedoil-waste-management">
      <h3 className="usedoil-step-title">1. Collection and Transportation</h3>
      <p className="usedoil-step-content">
        We manage the collection of used oil from various sources, including automotive service centers, industrial facilities, and households, through partnerships with local waste management organizations and certified recyclers across India.

      <div className="usedoil-waste-management">
      <h3 className="usedoil-step-title">2. Filtration and Cleaning</h3>
      <p className="usedoil-step-content">
        Upon arrival at our recycling partnersâ€™ facilities, the used oil undergoes filtration to remove contaminants such as dirt, metal shavings, and water, preparing it for further processing. Advanced cleaning techniques, such as vacuum distillation or centrifugation, are employed to ensure high-quality, clean used oil suitable for reuse, significantly enhancing the oil's quality to make it comparable to virgin oil.

      <div className="usedoil-waste-management">
      <h3 className="usedoil-step-title">3. Re-refining Process</h3>
      <p className="usedoil-step-content">
        The cleaned used oil is subjected to advanced re-refining processes that restore its original properties, including hydrotreatment to remove sulfur, nitrogen, and other impurities, and distillation to separate various components of the oil, allowing for the recovery of high-quality base oil. Our recycling partners use state-of-the-art machinery, including distillation units and hydrotreaters, to maximize efficiency and product quality.

      <h2 className="usedoil-subtitle">Technical Details of Used Oil Recycling</h2>
      <p className="usedoil-step-content">
        Used oil primarily consists of base oil and various additives. During recycling, the base oil is separated and purified to remove contaminants and restore its original properties. Advanced technologies used in the re-refining process can recover up to 90% of the base oil from used oil, making it a highly efficient recycling method. Recycling used oil requires significantly less energy compared to refining crude oil, leading to a reduction in overall carbon footprint and helping to lower greenhouse gas emissions associated with the extraction and processing of new oil, contributing to climate change mitigation.
